# CTF Flag 5: Secret Code Repository 

 
### Our team recently found out that few notorious people, tried to access our server, by misusing there access rights.
### So, we asked our developers to create a new branch, modify the flags, and deploy a new build.
### If you were one of them, we must be having your access logs. Don't worry ! We would not tell this to anyone. But, just know the fact that we are aware.
### Just FYI, be extra cautious when you try  *To Rob a Thief*
